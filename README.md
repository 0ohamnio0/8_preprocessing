# 8_preprocessing
preprocessing code for k_politician dataset
run.py is for downloading PDF file from clawled adress
pdf2jpg.py and pdf2image_2.py is for converting PDF to JPG image format.
image processing codes are not available for korean letter so we should go with file name converting process.
file_name_first.py and file_name.py is for that process.
and we crop images as facial detection size with image_processing.py
then use background_remove.py for removing background.
