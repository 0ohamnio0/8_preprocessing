preprocessing code for k_politician dataset

1. 'run.py' is for downloading PDF file from clawled adress


2. 'pdf2jpg.py' and 'pdf2image_2.py' is for converting PDF to JPG image format.


3. image processing codes are not available for korean letter so we should go with file name converting process.


'file_name_first.py' and 'file_name.py' is for that process.


4. and we crop images as facial detection size with 'image_processing.py'


5. then use 'background_remove.py' for removing background.
